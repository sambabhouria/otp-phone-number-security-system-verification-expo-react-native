# React Native and Node.js | SMS OTP Phone Number Verification

In this video, we are going to show you how to implement a secure phone number verification system in your
React Native app using Node.js back-end. With just a few lines of code, you'll be able to add an extra layer of protection
to your app and ensure that only legitimate users have access.
We will use TextFlow to send verification SMS and to verify the code.
You can see more documentation on their website: https://textflow.me
